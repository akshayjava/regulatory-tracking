## 2024-04-20 - [Optimize N+1 queries in SQLite fastAPI backend]
**Learning:** SQLite query loops in Python (N+1 queries) via DB fetchalls mapping models over REST endpoints can create significant bottlenecks even with an in-memory or highly optimized local file database. Using IN clauses for batch processing or `GROUP_CONCAT` in JOINs effectively solves this, turning O(N) operations into O(1) batched operations.
**Action:** Always batch related SQLite lookups using IN clauses or use JOINs rather than iterating and running separate subqueries per row.
